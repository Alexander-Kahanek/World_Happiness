# World Happiness Analysis

In this repository I go through a common kaggle dataset found [here...](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness)

* The analysis.ipynb is a python notebook done on google colab, [it can be viewed here...](https://alexander-kahanek.github.io/project/happiness.html)

* The raw folder contains the three csv files used for this analysis.
